      "For each county in Washington, create a GeoJSON file whose filename is the county name and whose contents are the polygons for the block groups within that county. This means that you will end up with as many GeoJSON files as there are counties in WA. Each such file should be named after a county and contain only the block groups from that county. \n",
      "\n",
      "    I started to asnwer the question by joining the Shapefile and the Database file together. I next created a cursor to go through the newly joined file and print out all the names of the 39 counties in Washington into a list. Once I had the list created I exported new shapefiles and other necessary data that was named after each of the 39 counties in Washington. After I had all of the counties in their respected Shapefiles, I checked to see if they worked properly in ArcMap, and they all worked flawlessly. I then turned all of the county Shapefiles into .geojson files and uploaded them onto GitHub to see if they also worked there. After much trial and error I was able to create all of the GeoJSON files as there are counties in Washington and display their polygons on GeoJSON on GitHub. \n"
